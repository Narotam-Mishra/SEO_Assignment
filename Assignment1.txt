Question 1 - What is SEO and explain the importance of SEO?

# SEO - SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” SEO means the process of improving your website to increase its visibility in search engines such as Chrome, Bing, etc. The higher or more frequently a website is displayed in a search engine list (like Google), the more visitors it is expected to receive.

Optimizing a website may involve editing the content to increase its relevance to specific keywords. Promoting a site to increase the number of links, is another SEO tactic.
